# ANC CPQ Engine - Executive Impress Document

## 🎯 The Pitch: What Natalia's Boss Needs to See

### **The Business Problem We're Solving**
ANC Sports receives **high-volume LED display requests** requiring **rapid turnaround** of pricing, specifications, and **branded budget proposals**. Current process is **entirely manual** across **multiple Excel tabs** - eating hours of estimator time per proposal.

### **The Magic Moment: End-to-End Automation**
**Manual Process (Current):**  
Client call → Manual Excel data entry → Look up product catalogs → Calculate pricing across 10+ tabs → Copy data to branded PDF → Manual address lookup → Format for client

**Automated Process (Our Solution):**  
Client conversation → **AI-guided questions** → **Automatic calculations** → **Dual output generated** (Excel audit + branded PDF)

**Time Reduction: 3-4 hours → 5 minutes per proposal**
